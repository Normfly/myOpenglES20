# myOpenglES20
Opengl ES 2.0 starter. Loads OBJ file / draw rectangle / draw text / lighted texture shaders / bump map texturing / send 2 textures to shaders / create a shaddow from obj file object.

The OBJ loader only supports a single texture. I used draw straight from vertex array instead of from a indexed array, so that uv coordinates from OBJ file from Blender maps coorectly.

Blender export options 

y up

write normals

export uv's

write materials



remember opengl es -y is up and +y is down.
