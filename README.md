# myOpenglES20
Opengl ES 2.0 starter. Loads OBJ file / draw rectangle / draw text / lighted texture shaders
The OBJ loader only supports a single texture. Each vertex can only have one UV texture coordinate. So, adding extruding faces might be neccesary with complicated texture wrapping.

Blender export options 
y up
write normals
export uv's
write materials

remember opengl es -y is up and +y is down.
